# my\_prime - exploration

The exploration part contains some (small) reasearch about a conjecture by Pomerance, Selfridge and Wagstaff (that we will name PSW).
The *report.pdf* contents are written in French, and the rest is in English.

The sources that I read to write the report and the contents of the tests are in the *SOURCES.md* and *HS-SOURCES.md* files.
The former contains links to purely mathematical resources, which I used generally,
while the latter contains links to resources I used for writing code (**HS** stands for **Haskell**).
