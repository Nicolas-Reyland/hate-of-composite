# hate-of-composite

This project is part of the entry competition for the LSE lab of the EPITA school.

This repo is split into two parts :
 - generation
 - exploration

## Generation
The generation directory contains the source code (C99) of a tool that can generate prime numbers and do primality tests.

## Exploration
The exploration part contains some research about a conjecture made by Pomerance, Selfridge and Wagstaff.
